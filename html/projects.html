                    The objective of this project was to create a compound machine using at least 4 different simple machines to accomplish an everyday task. We first individually brainstormed compound machine designs, in which I formulated ideas such as using a wheel driven axle to move a pulley, which dragged up a weight to ring a bell at the top of an inclined plane. Ultimately however, our team arrived at the consensus to build a design called the Button Pusher, its goal being to push a button by simply turning an axle. This goal would be achieved by driving an axle spinning a wheel (Ideal Mechanical Advantage (IMA = 0.186), with that wheel moving a pulley (IMA=2). After that, the pulley’s string would drag the weight (resistance) up an inclined plane (IMA=5). Once it reached the edge of the plane, the weight would hit a lever (IMA = 1.33), where the lever hit the button suspended in midair, thereby accomplishing the task of hitting the button. The total mechanical advantage for this compound machine was 2.53, meaning that it traveled 2.53 times the distance than if the mechanical advantage was 1, but required 2.53x less force to hit the button. One challenge posed by this initial design was of the base of the machine not having enough space to support the lever’s orientation, and this was solved by rotating the lever by 90 degrees so it was oriented vertically rather than horizontally. Another challenge was of the weight not falling down the inclined plane due to it being suspended in midair by the pulley’s string rather than falling onto the lever. Thus, during Design Modifications, as shown in the Documentation, I came up with the idea to change the way the weight was moved up the inclined plane, making it so instead of having the pulley directly pull the weight up the plane, it would instead pull up a box, in which after placing the weight in front of the box, it would be pushed by the box in tandem with the box being pulled up the plane, allowing the weight to fall onto the lever with the box left in midair, tied to the pulley. I also overall helped with the assembly of the Button Pusher prototype, helping with screwing in parts to ensure structural stability, building components like the wheel and axle and supporting c-channels, and testing the prototype by spinning the starting axle to make sure the button could be pushed properly. Our final design was showcased in this Video. Ultimately, I learned about how a medium such as a box was needed in order to have a pulley move and push down an object from an inclined plane, because the object directly attached to the pulley would be unable to fall down, thereby the desired object (weight) to fall down must not be directly attached, rather just be pushed by another object (box) which is moved/attached to/by the pulley. I also learned about the essence of simple machines and how by combining multiple simple machines, it was possible to greatly increase the Ideal Mechanical Advantage of the compound machine, as well as how important it was to plan as a team a detailed schedule on building plans each day, since it allowed for greater efficiency by utilizing all class time building purposefully.

                    The objective of this project was to create a technological innovation demonstrating skills from Principles of Engineering (POE). I first brainstormed potential entrepreneurship designs, in which I considered building a tennis court waiting machine, a manga reader application, and an airplane simulator. Ultimately, I arrived at the conclusion to create the airplane simulator, due to it containing the most POE skills, specifically following the idea of a Netlogo simulation. This simulation would be influenced on many factors such as plane weight, wing span, centroid placement, fuel rates for horizontal and vertical directions of plane, and an optional wind slider of power and direction. As can be seen from the  Documentation, the user would be able to freely manipulate the initial velocity, weight, wing span, wind direction/power, and fuel_rate sliders. Once they were satisfied with their choices, they would then click “set centroid”, which would allow them to click a spot on the map to serve as the centroid of the plane. This centroid would influence the direction the plane tilted toward, and was represented by a red dot. Then the simulated flight would start with the Start Flight button, and end when the airplane reached the top of the screen or fell to the ground (ex: no fuel left). One challenge posed by this initial design was how the centroid was being covered by the plane sprite, and after careful debugging I realized that it was since the centroid was a drawing, and drawings had lower status compared to sprites, thus I made the centroid a sprite too. Another challenge was how the plane kept being forced down by an overwhelming gravitational pull that grew parabolically with time. To solve this, I came up with the idea to move the plane’s vertical distance incrementally, not using the projectile equation -16t^2 + 32tsintheta + v0, due to the fact that because differing fuel rates existed due to the presence of x_fuel_rate and y_fuel_rate sliders, the acceleration was not constant. The only reason -16t^2 could have been used was due to acceleration being constant, thus I changed the equation for y distance to be ½ * a * t^2, allowing change in acceleration to update the effects of air travel. Overall, through the process of building this airplane simulator, I gained an understanding over Netlogo simulations and became acutely aware of how when you use a program with little capabilities, such as constraining the UI to fixed dimensions, it can greatly hinder the development of an ideal program. My simulator could only go on for a few seconds before the airplane flew off the map and ended the simulation, due to the screen size not going above 32x32. The syntax was also not very easy to understand, and no classes or objects seemed to be creatable besides defaults which also used unique syntax to call.

                The objective of this project was to create an art innovation using Python Turtle. My team decided to make an innovation focusing on the dangers of gacha systems. Our innovation was called ‘Rolling Simulator’, and consisted of a money counter which would decrement every time the ‘roll gacha’ button was pressed along with a visual representation of the decreasing money by showing a variety of self-created artwork (bill, coin, diamond) slowly burning along with the decreasing cost counter. We also allowed the user to change the background of the art piece every time the ‘change background’ button was pressed. My team created a git repository to easily commit and pull each other’s edits and add on to the project. We split the work into 3 main sections: creating the cost counter/money artwork, making the sword/character (item) artwork that would display on the screen each time the gacha was rolled, and creating a deforestation scene and info page about the dangers fo gambling.  My job was to make the sword artwork, cost counter, animate a deforestation scene once the user had rolled the gacha enough to the point that the items reached the top of the game window as well as create an info page once the user had spent all their in game resources/money highlighting the dangers of gambling and the much better alternatives there are for spending money. I learned about the essence of animation, being simply a collection of images at different locations in which each previous image is erased once the next image appears, during this project by working on animating a falling tree. I also learned the importance of using a centralized means of collaboration, such as using a git repository to easily share and pull each group member’s code, as all the commits made by each team member could be pulled and added to without needing to constantly wait for each other to be online. By using a system (git) in which we could store our early commits, it was easier to overcome challenges such as when we encountered errors in our code, as we could simply revert back to an old commit.

                The objective of this project was to learn about the possible causes of security breaches by simulating a cybersecurity team investigating a security breach. My team decided to methodically look through the Logs and Downloads provided, and my partner and I distributed the tasks to increase our efficiency. After we each finished our respective tasks, we verified each others’ work, making sure our stances correlated to reduce the possible fallacies in judgement. We established a simple means of communication to ensure strong collaboration, and with this means of communication I was able to notify my teammate whenever they were behind on a sprint, allowing the entire group to finish the project with time to spare, not needing to rush. The most freeform section of the project, pertaining to the modifications made on the original product and advice for the client, was the most enlightening part. I spent a lot of extra time brainstorming methods in which the product could be improved, going beyond just suggesting good naming procedure and even recommending the use of regular expressions to reduce redundancy and increase code robustness. A major idea I learned from this project was that by going beyond the minimum requirements presented by a client to improve your product, you will earn the client’s goodwill and demonstrate exemplary performance. I also learned about the necessity of keeping code robust and not prone to errors after modification, such as allowing both the strings “ok” and “Ok” to represent “status is fine”, which is done easily with regular expression’s IGNORECASE parameter.
