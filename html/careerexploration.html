            During my time in the engineering academy, I met many industry professionals through workplace field trips and guest speakers. These experiences were all very influential for my growth as an entrepreneur and engineer.

                    A very important presentation I listened to was from Donald James, a U.S. representative of the International Space Education Board, in which the key concepts that I learned about from Donald James’s presentation were about the topics of how a person needs manners and determination to succeed, and that people will encounter events that shape their future careers. I learned that people who have good manners can reach great heights, as from Donald’s own experience as an average student academically, he was able to climb up to one of the highest positions at NASA with manners. Donald also said that no matter how smart a person was, they wouldn’t be able to get far without manners. To prove this point, he brought up an anecdote about a prodigal pilot who was instantly rejected because he looked down on the pilot interviewing him, only to realize that that pilot was actually the boss of the aviation company he was applying to.

                        The most interesting presentation that I attended was Gary Ritcher’s presentation. He talked about the diverse job of a systems analyst and how a systems analyst will experience fields such as economics (allocation of funds), nuclear weapons testing, biological disease, and chemical composition of elements such as uranium. I learned that a science-oriented background ex: (knowledge of scientific procedures) or major allows for interesting endeavors that can amount to just about anything, such as designing instruments or aircrafts. Since we are learning in Principles of Engineering about how to build machines to accomplish specific tasks, it relates to how in the future an engineer may work on building machines to accomplish certain objectives as well, such as for improving instrument sound, or aircraft control.
                        For the field of Nuclear Science, Gary highlighted that during his project in dismantling Soviet nuclear warheads, he was tasked with rendering the thousands of nuclear materials that were dismantled ineffective and unable to be rebuilt as a nuclear weapon. This was done by grinding up the metal of the nuclear weapon to disable it and changing the chemical/nuclear properties of the nuke. He also worked in North Korea as an inspector for a nuclear reactor, trying to slow down North Korea’s nuclear progress.

                        One of the most influential field trips I went to was the Tech Innovation Summit, in which I participated in two workshops, being an Amazon AWS workshop as well as an AI shopping workshop. In the AWS workshop I learned about the ease at which frameworks make the creation of websites, as the speaker navigated through the AWS framework to publish a website. In the AI shopping workshop I learned about the way pictures are processed by a computer with its multiple GPUs and creates a metric for how similar it is to an object its being compared to. A demonstration of taking a photo of Baby Yoda created a 95% certainty alien, and a photo of the speaker herself created a 99% certainty of a human. A look into Amazon AWS also taught me how programming nowadays is mucuh more abstracted and GUI based than in the passed, with the growth of IDE's, frameworks, and prebuilt libraries.

                        I had also participated in the Patriot Jet Team field trip from my Principles of Engineering class, in which I learned about things like wingspan, lift, fuel effect on weight, and the importance of having lightweight materials in aerospace engineering. Every few minutes, a plane would take off from the field trip location, and I learned about the many types of airplanes that the Patriot Jet Team had. They mentioned the growth of drone companies like Volansi and Joby Aviation and how they leveraged the sky to deliver either materials or passengers to their destinations. I saw how simulation technology was important toward building machines that could help train pilots on aviation without facing the risks of actual flight, and how simulations should always aim to improve realism to become more useful.
