      My name is Richard, and I am currently studying Principles of Engineering (POE) at Dublin High School. The Computer Science field is one that encourages me to break the limits of my creativity, think outside the box, and reach a deeper level of understanding in other subjects such as mathematics. Equally important, I believe that the field of Computer Science holds the most impact for the future of society, which is why Computer Science is my career choice. Thus, my goal is to graduate from a Computer Science specialized college such as the California Institute of Technology with a degree in Computer Science. I have begun building a website based on a variety of ideas around culture and awareness while sharpening my web development skills in the process. Additionally, I hope to incrementally add more interesting features to my website as my programming skills continue developing. 
      <br><br>
      In POE, I've learned about various different mechanical engineering skills, and realized my interests lay elsewhere, in software engineering. From the Compound Machine Project, I learned about how to assemble pulleys, levers, wheel and axle, and combine them to push a button. With my Entrepreneurship Project, I built an airplane simulator and learned about a clunky piece of simulation software, Netlogo, and realized the limitations of software led to limitations of what programs I could develop. With Netlogo, the canvas was limited to 32x32, and also had a very constrained object system, making it hard to build an immersive airplane simulation.
      <br><br>
      I have found that in Computer Science, debugging is integral to the process of creating programs. My prolonged hours spent debugging a program that contained only 100-150 lines of code are a testament to this fact. Thus, I have found that the skills of patience and perseverance are incredibly important for a novice programmer, because of the huge frustration that inevitably pours out when simple programs take hours and hours to accomplish due to a variety of bugs that may stem from a simple syntax error to a lack of understanding regarding the API. In my AP CSP class, I also became largely frustrated when I had to learn a new module named turtle from scratch, and was unable to master the concept of drawing partial circles before the practical quiz. However, as I began familiarizing myself with the turtle API by tackling a variety of practice challenges, I aced my final practical exam that took place a few months later, which was a key milestone for me. Equally important was the Pico Capture The Flag competition among the students in my AP CSP class, in which I learned a plethora of new tools such as Wireshark for monitoring data packets, sleuthkit for analyzing img disks, and some commands in the terminal such as strings, wget, etc... I had initially started out with only basic command line knowledge, but after the competition in which I scored 2nd among my class, I became a lot more familiar with the terminal and the internet in general (Wireshark: data packet transmission, Transmission Control Protocol vs User Datagram Protocol, common port numbers such as 80 for HTTP. I learned that diligence and adaptability go hand in hand, as I am able to adapt to any type of task even if that task contains new content, as long as I diligently learn the inner workings of it. As of 2021, I have extensive experience in Python, HTML, and Javascript.
      <br><br>
      Through my large amounts of setbacks and successes in various programming endeavors, I have discovered a major thing about myself: That no matter how long something takes, or how frustrated I initially get, as long as I continue persisting through the first storm, the next tasks get progressively easier, and perhaps even fun! Thus, I hope to continue learning more concepts and become more experienced in the programming world alongside its continued development.
